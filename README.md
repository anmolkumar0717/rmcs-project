# Raja, Mantri, Chor, Sipahi: The Virtual Game

## 🕹️ Game Concept  

The game revolves around four characters:  
1. **Raja**: The King, who observes the game.  
2. **Mantri**: The Minister, who plays a crucial role in assisting the Sipahi.  
3. **Chor**: The Thief, whose identity must remain hidden.  
4. **Sipahi**: The Soldier, whose mission is to correctly identify the Chor among the characters.  

- If the **Sipahi** guesses the Chor correctly, the game ends with celebration.  
- If the **Sipahi** guesses wrong, a dramatic animation unfolds where a **Killer** executes the Sipahi with a sword.
